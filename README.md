This is a simple data analysis and visualization project. I have used following python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn. 

In this project, we will perform data exploration, cleaning, analysing and visualization on the apps present on Google's Play Store.

## Dataset
I have not included the dataset file in the repository. So, you could visit [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) link for the official dataset.
